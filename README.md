# Console Snake Game

This is a simple console-based Snake Game implemented in C++. The game provides a classic Snake gaming experience where the player controls a snake that moves around the screen, eats apples to grow longer, and tries to avoid colliding with the snake's own body and the game's borders.

## Game Controls

- Use the **WASD** keys to control the snake's direction.

## Game Features

- The game board consists of 'x' characters to represent the border, ' ' (space) characters as empty spaces, '@' as apples, 'B' as bonus items, 'D' as the snake's head, and 'o' as the snake's body parts.
- The player's score is displayed in the console.
- The snake can reduce body parts by consuming bonus items (if available).
